# Project 3 â€“ Traffic Light Controller

## Objective

Design a digital controller to control traffic at an intersection of a busy main street (North-South) and an occasionally used side street (East-West).

- North South must be Green for a minimum of 25 seconds and will remain Green until traffic is present on East-West

- East West will remain Green for a maximum of 25 seconds

- Yellow lights on both streets must be for 4 seconds

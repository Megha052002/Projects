# Behavioral Adder (64-bit)

## Objective

This model was an abstracted implementation of a full adder written in a behavioral Verilog sense with no specific logic circuit design.

This module tested: all possible combinations from 0 to 31 and, separately, two large 32-bit integers.

## Waveforms

Test 1: Simulation results from the Verilog representation of this Behavioral Adder **(All possible combinations from 0 to 31)**

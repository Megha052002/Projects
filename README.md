## Project_1 - [64-Bit Adder](https://github.com/Megha052002/Projects/tree/d087f2ceabce2011bc9cf6ee52124f19ada1e4b9/Project_1)
This project contains three different implementations of a 64-Bit Adder module using: ripple-carry adders, 2-bit look ahead adders, and a behavioral design.


## Project_2 - [Traffic Light Controller](https://github.com/Megha052002/Projects/tree/d087f2ceabce2011bc9cf6ee52124f19ada1e4b9/Project_2)
The aim of this project is to design a digital controller to control traffic at an intersection of a busy main street (North-South) and an occasionally used side street (East-West).
